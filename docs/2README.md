# Shared Skillet Website Development Documentation - March 6, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to develop and enhance the `sharedskillet.com` website, hosted on Amazon S3 with Route 53. The work was completed with guidance from Grok 3, an AI assistant by xAI, to create a professional-looking recipe-sharing platform.

## Tasks Completed Today

### 1. Initial Setup and Data Analysis
- **Analyzed `Complete.csv`**: Loaded and inspected a CSV file containing recipe data (e.g., `File Name`, `Title`, `Public URL`, `Recipe in Plain text`) with 103 rows.
- **Fixed Script Error**: Resolved an `argument of type 'float' is not iterable` error caused by `NaN` values in `Public URL` by adding `pd.notna()` checks in the Jupyter Notebook script.
- **Generated HTML**: Created a basic `recipes.html` file with embedded Google Drive video iframes using a Jupyter script.

### 2. Website Structure and Styling
- **Created `index.html`**: Designed a homepage with a hero section, navigation, and business plan popup, using responsive CSS with Flexbox and media queries.
- **Developed `recipes.html`**: Built a recipe page with a grid layout for 103 video cards, adding responsiveness for mobile and desktop browsers.
- **Added Logo and Name**: Integrated a `logo.png` file and displayed "Shared Skillet 🍳" alongside it in the header of both `index.html` and `recipes.html`.
- **Engaging Image**: Replaced the Unsplash API background with a static image (`cooking-hero.jpg`) from `https://unsplash.com/photos/person-cutting-vegetables-with-knife-yWG-ndhxvqY` on the homepage.

### 3. Pagination and Performance Optimization
- **Paginated Recipes**: Reduced load time by splitting 40 videos into 8 pages (5 videos each) using a Jupyter script, generating `recipes1.html` to `recipes8.html`.
- **Added Search Bar**: Implemented a client-side search bar in recipe pages to filter by title and description.
- **Adjusted Pagination**: Later modified to 10 videos per page (4 pages: `recipes1.html` to `recipes4.html`) to balance content and performance.
- **Fixed Path Issue**: Corrected an `[Errno 22] Invalid argument` error by using `os.makedirs` and `os.path.join` to save files to `..\frontend`, ensuring proper directory handling.

### 4. Deployment to S3
- **Uploaded Files**: Deployed `index.html`, `recipes.html` (later replaced by paginated files), `logo.png`, and `cooking-hero.jpg` to the `sharedskillet.com` S3 bucket.
- **Made Public**: Ensured all files were publicly accessible via ACL settings in the AWS Console.
- **Tested URLs**: Verified functionality at `http://sharedskillet.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html` and recipe page URLs.

### 5. Troubleshooting and Enhancements
- **Slow Page Fix**: Addressed slow loading of 40 videos by implementing pagination and `loading="lazy"` for iframes.
- **HTTPS Discussion**: Explored enabling HTTPS using Amazon CloudFront and AWS Certificate Manager, though not implemented today.
- **Responsiveness**: Confirmed mobile and desktop compatibility with media queries and flexible layouts.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Jupyter Notebook for script development and HTML generation.
- **Pandas**: For CSV data manipulation.
- **HTML/CSS**: For website structure and styling.
- **AWS S3**: For static hosting.
- **AWS Route 53**: For DNS management.
- **Unsplash**: For sourcing the engaging hero image.

## Next Steps
- **Implement HTTPS**: Set up CloudFront and ACM for secure `https://sharedskillet.com`.
- **Global Search**: Add server-side search across all recipe pages.
- **ML Integration**: Explore AI-powered recipe suggestions or image analysis.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use PageSpeed Insights to further optimize load times.

## Notes
- Ensure `..\data\Complete.csv` and `..\frontend` paths are valid relative to the script location.
- Keep `logo.png` and `cooking-hero.jpg` in the S3 bucket (e.g., root or `images/` folder) and update paths if necessary.
- Regularly test responsiveness and video loading on different devices.
